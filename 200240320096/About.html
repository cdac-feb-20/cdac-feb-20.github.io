            time frame that will swallow our atoms and produce new and beautiful things with them.<br><br><br> Our consciousness may 
            fade but our existence never can. its a statement that we,re REAL.<br><br><br>
            Space is interesting because its composed of us, its interesting because if another planets organisms were to answer
            that question they would unknowingly refer to us Earth as part of their answer.<br><br><br>
