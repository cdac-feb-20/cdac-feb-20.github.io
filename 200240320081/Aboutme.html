    <h2>Priyanka Suryavanshi</h2>
    <p>With due respect to all of you, i want to share few words about how i prepare this website</p>

<p>Currently i am persuing cdac from CDAC KHARGHAR,MUMBAI.On the day of 22nd of April 2020 new module named as AWP (Advanced Web Programing) has been started.It was verry new for me.I never ever heard about html,css but as topic started i was intrestingly involved in it.Then one of my friend suggested me to do the mini project on Jewellery design.and then i searched some good and intresting stuff regarding the topic. </p>

<p>I made this website using html and css format.took some help from frnds and internet.I used such a beautiful images of jewellery and desines.I used star rating,font icon,tables,and many more tags.I realised that it will take lots of efforts and hardwork to do a simple static website.But when i saw the result it was worth to see our own efforts,hardwork and creativity.
</p>
<p>I am proud on myself that i learnt how to make website in this lockdown.Because this frontend work is really so interesting.I used this lockdown period to do some creative work.Thank you.</p>
